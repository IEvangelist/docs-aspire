### Hosting integration health checks

The Azure Storage hosting integration automatically adds a health check for the storage resource, but it's limited to blobsâ€”assuming queues and tables are healthy when blobs are. Additionally, this health check is only added when running as an emulator, and it verifies that Azurite is running and that a connection can be established to it.

The hosting integration relies on the [ðŸ“¦ AspNetCore.HealthChecks.Azure.Storage.Blobs](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AspNetCore.HealthChecks.Azure.Storage.Blobs) NuGet package.
